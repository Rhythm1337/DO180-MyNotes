# Topic 1
## Containers:
A **Container** is a running instance of a **Container Image**.
A *Container Image** is a single file (tarball), loaded the files needed by your application. Container images have **metadata** which describe the image.
A **Entry Point** is a container image metadata that describes the command to be executed whenever a comtainer is started from a **Container Image**.

Where to get container images:
- registry.redhat.io (By RedHat)
- registry.connect.redhat.com (By RedHat but Community Contributed)
- quay.io (Community Contributed)
- other registries

Container Runtimes:
- runc
- podman (simple version of runc)
- cri-o
- docker

> cri-o stands for container runtime interface for oci which is images and runtime.

# Topic 3
# Important lab commands
 ```
ssh lab@utility
./wait.sh
```

# Commands
```
which oc
which kubectl

ls -l $(which oc)
ls -l $(which kubectl)

md5sum $(which oc)
md5sum $(which kubectl)

```
For Tab Completion:
```
oc completion bash >  .oc_bash_completion.sh
echo "source .oc_bash_completion.sh" >> ~/.bashrc
```
## Navigate the OpenShift web console
Login and passwords
```
oc login -u admin -p redhatocp https:api.ocp4.example.com:6443
oc login -u developer -p developer https:api.ocp4.example.com:6443
```
Find console link
```
oc whoami --show-console
```

Helm is the package manager of kubernetes.
Create a project and test stuff

Key Concepts:
Pods: The smallest unit of a Kubernetes-managed containerized application. A pod consists of one or more containers.
Deployments: The operational unit that provides granular management of a running application.
Projects: A Kubernetes namespace with additional annotations that provide multitenancy scoping for applications.
Routes: Networking configuration to expose your applications and services to resources outside the cluster.
Operators: Packaged Kubernetes applications that extend cluster functions.
