## Containers:
A **Container** is a running instance of a **Container Image**.
A *Container Image** is a single file (tarball), loaded the files needed by your application. Container images have **metadata** which describe the image.
A **Entry Point** is a container image metadata that describes the command to be executed whenever a comtainer is started from a **Container Image**.

Where to get container images:
- registry.redhat.io (By RedHat)
- registry.connect.redhat.com (By RedHat but Community Contributed)
- quay.io (Community Contributed)
- other registries
