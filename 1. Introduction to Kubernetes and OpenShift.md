# Topic 1 Containers and Kubernetes

## Containers:
A **Container** is a running instance of a **Container Image**.
A **Container Image** is a single file (tarball), loaded the files needed by your application. Container images have **metadata** which describe the image.
A **Entry Point** is a container image metadata that describes the command to be executed whenever a comtainer is started from a **Container Image**.

Where to get container images:
- registry.redhat.io (By RedHat)
- registry.connect.redhat.com (By RedHat but Community Contributed)
- quay.io (Community Contributed)
- other registries

Container Runtimes:
- runc
- podman (simple version of runc)
- cri-o
- docker

## Kubernetes:
Still understanding


# Topic 2 Red Hat OpenShift Components and Editions

## OpenShift projects in a OpenShift release:
- etcd
- cri-o
- podman
- coreos
- helm
- ceph
- grafana
- prometheous

## Managed RedHat OpenShift Services:
- RedHat OpenShift Service on AWS
- Azure OpenShift OpenShift
- RedHat OpenShift Service on IBM Cloud
- RedHat OpenShift Dedicated
  > on public cloud or on-premises physical or virtual infrastructure

## For Learing and trying out OpenShift
- OpenShift Local
- OpenShift Developer Sandbox(30 days free trial)

# Topic 3 Navigate the OpenShift Web Console + some cli commands

# Important lab commands
 ```
ssh lab@utility
./wait.sh
```

# Commands
```
which oc
which kubectl

ls -l $(which oc)
ls -l $(which kubectl)

md5sum $(which oc)
md5sum $(which kubectl)

```
For Tab Completion:
```
oc completion bash >  .oc_bash_completion.sh
echo "source .oc_bash_completion.sh" >> ~/.bashrc
```
## Navigate the OpenShift web console
Login and passwords
```
oc login -u admin -p redhatocp https:api.ocp4.example.com:6443
oc login -u developer -p developer https:api.ocp4.example.com:6443
```
Find console link
```
oc whoami --show-console
```

Helm is the package manager of kubernetes.
Create a project and test stuff

## Key Concepts:

**Pods:** The smallest unit of a Kubernetes-managed containerized application. A pod consists of one or more containers.

**Deployments:** The operational unit that provides granular management of a running application.

**Projects:** A Kubernetes namespace with additional annotations that provide multitenancy scoping for applications.

**Routes:** Networking configuration to expose your applications and services to resources outside the cluster.

**Operators:** Packaged Kubernetes applications that extend cluster functions.

## Topic 4 Guided Exercise: Navigate the OpenShift Web Console
```
lab start intro-navigate

oc login -u developer -p developer https:api.ocp4.example.com:6443

oc whoami --show-console
```
**Select Developer**

Create new project

add

> name: intro-navigat

> display-name: intro-navigate

> description: project from intro-navigate


topology

> start building your own application

> httpd(samples)

**Select Administrator**

workloads

> pods

> deployments


networking

> services


# Topic 5 Monitor an OpenShift Cluster
## Debug:

How it works

oc debug node
---->
oc debug pod
---->
container
---->
chroot /host
---->
node running RHCOS

On web console:
compute
> nodes

in terminal section of nodes
```
chroot /root
systemctl status crio
```

On normal terminal now:
```
oc get nodes
oc debug node/master01
chroot /host
crictl ps
```
