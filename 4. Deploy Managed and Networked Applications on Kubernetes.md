# Deploy Managed and Networked Applications on Kubernetes:

# Topic 1 Deploy Applications from Images and Templates

**Imperative approach** 
- oc create depoly --> creates depoly
- oc expose depoly --> creates service
- oc expose service --> creates route

**Ways to depoly apps on **OpenShift**:**
- pre-existing image
- containerfile / dockerfile
- s2i (source to image)
- helm (package management tool)
- CI / CS
- YAML / JSON manifests
- Templates

**Template:**
Template will create what you tell it to create it!
- bc
- is
- depoly
- pvc
- svc
- route
- sq
- and more...
