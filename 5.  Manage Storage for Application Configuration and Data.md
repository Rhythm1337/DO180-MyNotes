# Manage Storage for Application Configuration and Data

# Topic 1 Externalize the Configuration of Applications

## Envoirnment variables file content:

**Configmaps:**

ConfigMap resource type.
Contains the configuration data.
Points to an encoded file in base64 that contains non-UTF-8 data

**Secrets:**

Passwords
Sensitive configuration files
Credentials to an external resource, such as an SSH key or OAuth token and more

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By default, configuration maps and secrets are not encrypted. To encrypt your secret data at rest, you must encrypt the Etcd database. When enabled, Etcd encrypts the following resources: secrets, configuration maps, routes, OAuth access tokens, and OAuth authorization tokens. Encrypting the Etcd database is outside the scope of the course.

Creating Configuration Maps:

```
oc create configmap my-config --from-literal my-key=amongus
```

Creating Secrets:

```
oc create secret generic secret my-secret --from-literal my-key=minecraft
```
