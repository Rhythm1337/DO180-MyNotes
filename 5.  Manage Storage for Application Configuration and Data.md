# Manage Storage for Application Configuration and Data

# Topic 1 Externalize the Configuration of Applications

## Envoirnment variables file content:

**Configmaps:**

ConfigMap resource type.
Contains the configuration data.
Points to an encoded file in base64 that contains non-UTF-8 data

**Secrets:**

Passwords
Sensitive configuration files
Credentials to an external resource, such as an SSH key or OAuth token and more

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By default, configuration maps and secrets are not encrypted. To encrypt your secret data at rest, you must encrypt the Etcd database. When enabled, Etcd encrypts the following resources: secrets, configuration maps, routes, OAuth access tokens, and OAuth authorization tokens. Encrypting the Etcd database is outside the scope of the course.

Creating Configuration Maps and Secrets:

```
oc create configmap my-config --from-literal my-key=amongus
oc create secret generic secret my-secret --from-literal my-key=minecraft
```

Deleting Secrets and Configuration Maps:

```
oc delete configmap my-config -n games
```

# Topic 2 Guided Exercise: Externalize the Configuration of Applications:
done!

**PVC (persistent volume claim) ----> request for storage**
- size
- access mode (rwo[only 1 pod can read and write], rwx[many pods can read and write from the same storage{the filesystem needs to support it}], rox[many pods can read from storage but cant write it it])
- storage class (slow-transfer, fast-transfer, superfast-transfer OR nfs, lvms, odf)
> storage provider
> - ODF(volume), ceph, cloud


**PV ----> it represents a read storage volume**
