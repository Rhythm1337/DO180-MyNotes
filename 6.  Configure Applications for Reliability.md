# 6.  Configure Applications for Reliability.md

# Topic 1 Application High Availability with Kubernetes:

**Concepts of Deploying Highly Available Applications**

- Tolerates restarts
- Responds to health probes, such as the startup, readiness, and liveness probes
- Supports multiple simultaneous instances
- Has well-defined and well-behaved resource usage
- Operates with restricted privileges

**Kubernetes Application Reliability**

-Restarting pods: By configuring a restart policy on a pod, the cluster restarts misbehaving instances of an application.
- Probing: By using health probes, the cluster knows when applications cannot respond to requests, and can automatically act to mitigate the issue.
- Horizontal scaling
