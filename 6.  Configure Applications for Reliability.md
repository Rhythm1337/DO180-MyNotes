# 6.  Configure Applications for Reliability.md

# Topic 1 Application High Availability with Kubernetes:

**Concepts of Deploying Highly Available Applications**

- Tolerates restarts
- Responds to health probes, such as the startup, readiness, and liveness probes
- Supports multiple simultaneous instances
- Has well-defined and well-behaved resource usage
- Operates with restricted privileges

**Kubernetes Application Reliability**

- Restarting pods: By configuring a restart policy on a pod, the cluster restarts misbehaving instances of an application.
- Probing: By using health probes, the cluster knows when applications cannot respond to requests, and can automatically act to mitigate the issue.
- Horizontal scaling: When the application load changes, the cluster can scale the number of replicas to match the load.

# Topic 3 Application Health Probes

**Kubernetes Probes**
- Crash mitigation by automatically attempting to restart failing pods
- Failover and load balancing by sending requests only to healthy pods
- Monitoring by determining whether and when pods are failing
- Scaling by determining when a new replica is ready to receive requests

**Probe Types**

1. Readiness Probe: It determines whether the application is ready to serve requests. A failed probe results in the pods endpoint gets removed from service.
2. Liveness Probe: Failed probe results in the pod's container being killed and then restarted from the image.
3. Startup Probe: A failed probe results in the pod not starting.

**Tests:**

- http get access url and check for http codes 200 - 399
- socket connection check with TCP connection can be made (it does not tell if the service is actually working but tells us about the connection being up or not)
- container commands run expecting a return code

**Probe Help Commands**

```
oc set probe --help | less
```

**Add changes via web gui by clicking "add health checks" and continue the setup there**
or 
**CLI**

```
 oc set probe deployment/test --readiness --failure-threshold 3 --period-seconds 5 --get-url http://:8080/health-chc
```
